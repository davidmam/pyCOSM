pyCOSM instructions
===================

This wrapper is not endorsed, maintained, supported or approved by cosm.com. Use at your own risk.

Installation:
-------------

python setup.py install


The modules:

PyCOSM.COSM.COSM is the main wrapper. 
It manages the latest readings from each Datastream (as DataPoints) and will upload them to Cosm.com as required. 

You will need: 
A cosm.com API key (which means you will have already have registered on the cosm web site.)
A cosm feed id (or one can be created) to which the API key gives access.

A net connection.

Using pyCOSM:
=============

Exceptions will be thrown if there is an error.

1) with an existing feed

from pyCOSM.COSM import *

keyid='MYCOSMAPIKEYID1234567890'
feedid=12345

cosm=COSM(feedid=feedid, apikey=keyid)

cosm.get() # retrieves current settings from COSM for that feed id.

# get the current values for all datastreams

cosm.current_values()

#add a datapoint
value=23 # room temperature here.
dp=DataPoint(value) # defaults to current time datatime.datetime.now()
# dp=DataPoint(value, timestamp) #for a datapoint at a given timestamp.

cosm.addDatapoint(dp, 'datastream id') #if a datastream with id 'datastream id' doesn't exist it will be created.

cosm.update() # sends the latest values for each datastream (since the last update) to cosm.

2) to add a new datastream manually

ds=Datastream('datastream id')

cosm.addDatastream(ds)

3. to create a new datafeed (collection of datastreams)

cosm=COSM(apikey=keyid)

cosm.create()

feedid=cosm.feedid
